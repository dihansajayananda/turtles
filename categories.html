			<h3>Loggerhead Turtle</h3>
			<p>The Loggerhead turtle is a large marine reptile that is widely distributed throughout the world. They are named for their large heads, which can measure up to nine inches wide in adults. Their carapace (upper shell) is typically reddish-brown in color, while their plastron (lower shell) is usually a lighter yellow-brown.
                Loggerhead turtles are known for their strong, powerful jaws that are adapted for crushing and grinding hard-shelled prey such as crabs and other crustaceans. They are also known to eat jellyfish, squid, and fish.
                Loggerhead turtles are found in all the world's oceans, with the largest populations found in the Atlantic Ocean. They are a long-lived species, with individuals known to live for more than 50 years. These turtles are also known for their impressive migrations, with some individuals traveling thousands of miles each year between nesting and foraging areas.
                Like other sea turtle species, Loggerheads face a variety of threats, including habitat loss and degradation, accidental capture in fishing gear, and ingestion of marine debris. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this species, including measures to reduce bycatch in fisheries and protect important nesting and foraging habitats.</p>

			<h3>Hawksbill Turtle</h3>
			 <p>The hawksbill turtle is a medium-sized sea turtle that can be found in tropical waters around the world, including Sri Lanka. It is easily recognized by its narrow, pointed beak and beautiful, colorful shell, which is highly valued for its decorative purposes. Hawksbill turtles are primarily herbivores, feeding on sponges, algae, and other marine plants, but they also eat small invertebrates. Unfortunately, the hawksbill turtle is listed as critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and accidental capture in fishing gear. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this magnificent species and ensure its survival for future generations.</p>

			<h3>Green Turtle</h3>
			<p>Green turtles are a species of sea turtles that are found in Sri Lanka. They are named after the green color of their body fat, which comes from their herbivorous diet of seagrass and algae. They have a relatively small head and limbs compared to their large body, and their carapace (upper shell) is typically a brownish-olive color.
                Green turtles are known for their migrations across the ocean, traveling long distances to reach their nesting beaches. In Sri Lanka, green turtles are known to nest on the beaches along the southern coast, particularly in the area of Rekawa Beach. During the nesting season, female green turtles come ashore to lay their eggs in the sand, and hatchlings emerge from the nests about two months later.
                Green turtles are an important part of Sri Lanka's marine ecosystem, and they are protected under Sri Lankan law. Despite this, they face numerous threats, including habitat loss and degradation, accidental capture in fishing gear, and poaching of eggs and adults for consumption and trade. Conservation efforts, such as the protection of nesting beaches and the use of turtle excluder devices in fishing gear, are helping to protect green turtles in Sri Lanka.</p>

			<h3>Leatherback Turtle</h3>
			<p>The Leatherback Turtle is the largest of all living turtles and can weigh over 900 kg. In Sri Lanka, they are found on the east coast and are considered to be critically endangered due to egg poaching, hunting, and incidental capture in fishing gear. Leatherback Turtles are unique in that they lack a hard, bony shell like other turtles and instead have a leathery, rubbery shell. They also have a distinctive ridged, elongated body that helps them swim efficiently in the open ocean. Leatherback Turtles are known for their long migrations, traveling thousands of miles between their feeding and nesting grounds. In Sri Lanka, they come to nest between March and July. Conservation efforts, such as protecting nesting beaches and reducing bycatch in fishing gear, are critical to the survival of these majestic creatures.</p>

            <h3>Olive Ridley Turtle</h3>
            <p>Olive Ridley sea turtles are one of the several species of sea turtles found in Sri Lanka. They are a medium-sized species of turtle that typically weigh between 35-50 kg and measure around 70-100 cm in length. 
                Olive Ridleys are named after their olive-colored shells, which are heart-shaped and highly curved. They have a distinctive V-shaped pattern of overlapping scales on the top of their heads. 
                In Sri Lanka, Olive Ridley sea turtles are known to nest along the country's south and east coasts, with some of the most popular nesting sites being Rekawa, Kalametiya, and Bundala. During the nesting season, female Olive Ridleys come ashore to lay their eggs in the sand. The hatching season starts around 50-60 days later, and the hatchlings make their way to the sea. 
                Unfortunately, Olive Ridley sea turtles are threatened by habitat destruction, pollution, and accidental capture in fishing nets. Conservation efforts are being made to protect their nesting sites and raise awareness about their importance in Sri Lanka's marine ecosystem.</p>

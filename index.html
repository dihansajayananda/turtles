			<h2>Turtle Population</h2>
		</div>

				<p>Sri Lanka is home to several species of sea turtles, including the Green Turtle, the Hawksbill Turtle, the Loggerhead Turtle, the Olive Ridley Turtle, and the Leatherback Turtle. These turtles are an important part of the country's marine ecosystem, and they play a critical role in maintaining the health of coral reefs and seagrass beds.

                    However, sea turtle populations in Sri Lanka, as in many other parts of the world, are facing a number of threats. These include habitat loss and degradation, pollution, bycatch in fishing nets, and poaching for their eggs, meat, and shells. In recent years, conservation efforts have been underway to protect and conserve sea turtle populations in Sri Lanka, including the establishment of protected areas, hatcheries, and public education programs. As a result, there has been some success in restoring turtle populations, but continued efforts are needed to ensure their long-term survival.</p>

				<p>Sea turtle babies, also known as hatchlings, are an important part of the sea turtle population in Sri Lanka. After female sea turtles lay their eggs on the beach, the eggs incubate in the sand for several weeks before the hatchlings emerge and make their way to the sea. However, many hatchlings do not survive this journey, as they are often preyed upon by birds and other predators, or disoriented by artificial light and other human-made obstacles.

                    To help increase the survival rate of sea turtle hatchlings in Sri Lanka, several hatcheries have been established along the country's coastline. These hatcheries protect turtle eggs from predation and poaching and provide a safe environment for hatchlings to emerge and make their way to the sea. Additionally, public education programs and outreach efforts are aimed at raising awareness of the importance of sea turtles and the need to protect their habitats in order to ensure the long-term survival of these fascinating creatures.</p>

				<p>Certainly! Pregnant female sea turtles are also a vital part of the turtle population in Sri Lanka. Female turtles typically come ashore to lay their eggs on the same beaches where they themselves hatched, a process known as natal homing.

                    During the nesting season, which typically lasts from around November to April, female sea turtles may visit the same beach several times to lay multiple clutches of eggs. These clutches can contain anywhere from 50 to 200 eggs, depending on the species of turtle. After laying their eggs, the females return to the sea, leaving the eggs to incubate in the sand for several weeks.
                    
                    It's important to note that pregnant sea turtles face a variety of threats, including habitat loss and degradation, climate change, and entanglement in fishing gear. Conservation efforts aimed at protecting sea turtles and their habitats can help to mitigate these threats and ensure that pregnant turtles continue to play a vital role in the turtle population in Sri Lanka and beyond.</p>

			<h2>Fundamental link in marine ecosystems</h2>

				<p>Absolutely! Sea turtles play a fundamental role in marine ecosystems in Sri Lanka and around the world. As both predators and prey, they help to maintain the delicate balance of life in the oceans.In addition to their role as predators and prey, sea turtles also play an important ecological role through their influence on seagrass beds and coral reefs. As turtles graze on seagrass, they help to promote new growth and maintain healthy meadows, which in turn provide important habitat and food for a variety of marine animals. Additionally, the nutrients excreted by turtles help to fertilize seagrass and coral, leading to increased productivity and diversity in these ecosystems.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image">
				<img src="images/f2.png.jpg" alt="Hatchery 2">
				<p>One important way in which sea turtles contribute to marine ecosystems is through their diet. Depending on the species, sea turtles may eat seagrasses, algae, jellyfish, crustaceans, and other marine creatures. By grazing on these organisms, sea turtles help to control their populations, preventing them from overrunning the ecosystem and disrupting the food chain.

                    Sea turtles are also an important source of food for many predators, including sharks, crocodiles, and birds of prey. When sea turtle populations decline, it can have a ripple effect throughout the entire ecosystem, affecting the abundance and distribution of other species.</p>

				<p>In addition to their ecological importance, sea turtles also have cultural and economic significance in Sri Lanka and other coastal communities around the world. In Sri Lanka, sea turtles are revered as sacred animals and are a popular tourist attraction. Conservation efforts aimed at protecting sea turtles and their habitats can help to ensure that they continue to play a vital role in marine ecosystems and provide benefits to human communities for generations to come.</p>

			<h2>Turtle projects</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="image-row">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="images/s1.png.png" alt="Threat 1">
				<p>Turtle rescue and rehabilitation: Organizations such as marine wildlife rehabilitation centers rescue and rehabilitate injured or sick turtles. They provide medical treatment and care until the turtles are healthy enough to be released back into the wild.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image">
				<img src="images/s2.png.png" alt="Threat 2">
				<p>Community outreach and education: Many organizations work to educate local communities about the importance of sea turtles and the role they play in the marine ecosystem. They also teach people how they can help protect sea turtles and their habitats.</p>

			<div class="image">
			<img src="images/s3.png.png" alt="Threat 3">
			<p>In Sri Lanka, there are several turtle hatcheries that protect sea turtle nests and ensure the safe hatching of eggs. After the baby turtles hatch, they are carefully collected and released into the ocean, where they can begin their long journey to adulthood. This process helps to increase the chances of survival for the hatchlings, as they are vulnerable to predators and other threats on the beach.</p>
